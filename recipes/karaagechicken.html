    <h1>Karaage Chicken</h1>
    <img src = "/images/karaagechicken.jpg">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <a>Karaage is Japanese fried chicken that is usually made with chicken thighs but I used chicken breast. It's much lighter in taste and lower in calories.
    </a>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2  tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sake</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced freshed garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 pound chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, sake, oil, ginger, and garlic in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add chicken pieces and mix well with the marinade. Marinate at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Combine flour and cornstarch on a plate. Coat marinated chicken with flour-cornstarch mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Fry chicken pieces in batches until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove from the hot oil, transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Increase heat until oil is 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry chicken pieces for another 1 to 2 minutes in the hot oil until very crisp.
        </li>
    </ol>
